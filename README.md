## 20 June 2025

🆕 A feature has been launched for On Demand Courses, where if the videos are categorized into Modules, then the Lessons under that Module will be nested beneath it.

e.g.: Module 1: X, Lesson 1: A, Lesson 2: B will be under the following structure when downloaded:

```
~/Some Course Name (2025)/Module 1 - X/Lesson 1 - A/001. Video1.mp4
~/Some Course Name (2025)/Module 1 - X/Lesson 1 - A/002. Video2.mp4
~/Some Course Name (2025)/Module 1 - X/Lesson 1 - A/003. Video3.mp4
~/Some Course Name (2025)/Module 1 - X/Lesson 2 - B/...
~/Some Course Name (2025)/Module 1 - X/Lesson 2 - C/...
~/Some Course Name (2025)/Module 1 - X/Lesson 2 - D/...
...
```
