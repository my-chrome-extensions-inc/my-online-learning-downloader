# My Online Learning Downloader

Donations helped keep this extension going.

Unfortunately the donations have not kept up with the running costs for the maintenance of this extension, so it will be removed from all platforms by the end of June 2025.

If the situation changes and support for this extension grows, then it can continue to stay on the platforms they're currently distributed on.
