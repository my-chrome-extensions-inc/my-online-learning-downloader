## 19 June 2025

A feature has been launched for On Demand Courses, where if the videos are categorized into Modules, then the Lessons under that Module will be nested beneath it.

e.g.: Module 1: X, Lesson 1: A, Lesson 2: B will be under the following structure when downloaded:

```
~/Module 1 X/Lesson 1 A/001. Video1.mp4
~/Module 1 X/Lesson 1 A/002. Video2.mp4
~/Module 1 X/Lesson 1 A/003. Video3.mp4
~/Module 1 X/Lesson 2 B/...
~/Module 1 X/Lesson 2 C/...
~/Module 1 X/Lesson 2 D/...
...
```
